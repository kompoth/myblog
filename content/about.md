I graduated as M. Sc. in Physics with honors from the Lomonosov MSU in 2022. After graduting I decided to switch from science to IT.
As much as I was interested in my scientific research, I have been always eager to create impactful and practical solutions.
Currently, I work as a Senior Python Developer in FinTech and Web3 areas.
Here you can find my full (but not necessarily up-to-date) [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LldRAZmrse_6TI1MCkFwcnfFfxSVk187/view?usp=sharing).

As a physics department student, I researched nuclear processes during astrophysical events, such as supernovas and star collisions.
I used various scientific models, both nuclear and astrophysical, implemented in C++ and Fortran, and did a lot of work processing the obtained data with Python and Perl.

Since the very beginning of my research in 2018 I have been using Linux as my primary OS for the sake of convenience. This is when my enthusiam for Linux started.
I tend to keep my configuration files in [this repo](https://github.com/kompoth/dotfiles).
